	<h1>How to Build Good Credit</h1>
</header>
	<main>
	<p> A few of the ideas today sound like common sense but not following a rule here or there can easily 
	derail the path to good credit.  Having a job for a long time or living in one place for a long time  
	Though these two don't directly affect your score, they represent stability when applying for credit. 
	Paying your bills on time is easily one of the most important things you can do.  Also not having a lot 
	of debt is also good for your credit.  Just because you can get credit doesn't mean you should.
	</p>	
		<ul>
			<li>Pay your bills on time.</li>
			<li>Keep a credit card with 90% availabe limit on it.</li>
			<li>Keep your debt to income ratio very low.</li>
		</ul>
